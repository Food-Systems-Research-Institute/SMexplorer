# Sustainability Metrics Explorer

## About
 
The Sustainability Metrics project is a collaborative effort to measure food system sustainability in the Northeast led by the University of Vermont Food Systems Research Institute and the USDA ARS in Burlington, Vermont.

This repository houses an R Shiny Dashboard app that allows for interactive exploration of metrics and spatial data. It follows the [golem](https://github.com/ThinkR-open/golem/tree/master) framework for Shiny app development.
